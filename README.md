# MACHINE-LEARNING
This is a machine learning repository that provides a collection of tools and tutorials for building and deploying machine learning models. The repository includes a variety of popular algorithms, such as neural networks, decision trees, and k-means, as well as code for preprocessing and visualizing data. The repository also includes Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step instructions for training and evaluating models on sample datasets. Additionally, the repository includes code for deploying models as web services using popular framework like Tensorflow, Pytorch or scikit-learn, and it's easily extensible for other framework or library. This repository is intended for developers and data scientists with some experience in machine learning, and is a great starting point for anyone looking to get started with building their own models.
